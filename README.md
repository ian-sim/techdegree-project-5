Awesome Startup Employee Directory

I am aiming for an exceeds expectations grade for this project.

For this project I have used fetch to request data for 12 random users and generate an employee directory with profile cards for each of the employees.

Each of the profile cards can be clicked to display a modal window with more information on the employee.

I have also added the search bar functionality which will display only the employees whose names include the users input in the search bar. I have also set this up so that it filters on keyup events.

The modal windows also have the next and previous buttons so that whilst a modal window is open the user is able to switch to the next or previous employee card in the directory.

To alter the CSS I have added a subtle box-shadow to each of the profile cards, altered the background colour, slightly increased the <h1> font size and added the transform scale() for the cards when the user hovers over them.

I had a bit of trouble with the structure of this project when dynamically adding event listeners and would really like to hear how I could have structured this project more effectively.
I also wanted to utilise async/await but was unsure of exactly where it would fit.
